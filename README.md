Project Description:

HUFF-DUFF, is an indoor navigation app that aims to simplify and enhance the way individuals navigate the indoor spaces of the campus, ultimately improving overall campus experience and efficiency . The  app assists students, faculties and visitors in navigating seamlessly within the buildings and facilities of the campus. HUFF-DUFF app leverages advanced technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)& Wi-Fi positioning to provide accurate and intuitive navigation experiences. The app utilizes a combination of indoor maps, real-time location tracking, and personalized routing algorithms to guide users through the campus buildings efficiently.

 Using indoor atlas SDK the inside of a building is mapped and the position of the individual is obtained using the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS. Indoor positioning systems (IPS) locate people inside a building using radio signals, geomagnetic fields, inertial sensor data, barometric pressure, camera data or other sensory information collected by a smartphone device or tablet. Thus it is able to provide directions from the userâ€™s current location to the destination.
